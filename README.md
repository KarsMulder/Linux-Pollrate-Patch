This repository contains a highly experimental patch for the Linux kernel which provides a new `usbcore.interrupt_interval_override` module parameter that can be used to forcefully override the interrupt polling interval of an USB device.

# Usage

This parameter will override the polling interval on all interrupt-type endpoints on a device identified by their vendor and product ID. An example usage of this parameter would be:

```usbcore.interrupt_interval_override=045e:00db:16,1bcf:0005:2```

This gives all USB devices with id `045e:00db` an interrupt interval for 16ms, and all USB devices with id `1bcf:0005` an interrupt interval of 2ms. You can discover the id of your devices using the `lsusb` tool.

This parameter can be set at boot time by adding a parameter to your linux command line in your bootloader, or at runtime by writing to the file `/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/interrupt_interval_override`. For example:

```echo "045e:00db:16,1bcf:0005:2" | sudo tee /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/interrupt_interval_override > /dev/null```

If this parameter is modified at runtime, you may need to unplug&replug the affected USB device.

Not all USB devices support all polling intervals. Using a polling interval other than the one requested by the device may have unintended consequences. Use at your own risk. This program is provided WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY of any kind.

# Applying the patch

At the time of writing, this patch should be applicable to the latest mainline kernel, and probably every kernel since 5.9-rc1. The patch will NOT directly apply to the 5.8.* kernels or older. To create a patched version of the Linux source code, do something like:

```
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux
git clone https://github.com/KarsMulder/Linux-Pollrate-Patch
cd linux
git apply ../Linux-Pollrate-Patch/pollrate.patch
```

The way to compile and install the kernel is distribution specific.


File locations:

/etc/custom-device-pollrates/custom-device-pollrates.conf
/usr/bin/custom-device-pollrates.sh
/usr/lib/systemd/system/custom-device-pollrates.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system-presets/99-custom-device-pollrates.preset

Start the service:

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable --now custom-device-pollrates.service

Add devices here:
/etc/custom-device-pollrates/custom-device-pollrates.conf
